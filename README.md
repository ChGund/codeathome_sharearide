# Final project for the Digital Shapers #codeathome program 2024 by TechLabs 
# Topic: "Tech for Good"

## Project name
Share a Ride

## Problem statement
In the countryside the bus connections can be really bad. There might be only one bus a day (driving pupils to school). At the same time, more and more grocery stores in villages have to close down, and doctors are rare in small places. This is a real problem for people who cannot ride a car (anymore) - elderly, handicapped or children/youth.
On the other hand, there are people driving to bigger towns with grocery stores regularly. They might have some space to take another person or two in return for a small fare. With gas getting a lot more expensive these days, they might be happy to do so. 

## Solution
Connection the countryside: the idea is to create a website where drivers and people in need of a ride can get connected. This is specifically meant for short rides to the next bigger town and desirably back, as well as for offering regular rides. 

On our website drivers can enter their ride with the following information:
+ locations: where from and where to
+ start and return times
+ amount of available seats 
+ fare
+ extras: i.e. space for a wheelchair
+ they can create regular, repeating rides (i.e. Friday, 6 p.m.)

Riders can browse through the offered rides, and book a ride on the platform.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
